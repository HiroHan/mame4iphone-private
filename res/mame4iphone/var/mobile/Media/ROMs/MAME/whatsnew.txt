Changes by Slaanesh:
Use Cyclone for M68010 as well as M68000 CPUs.
This gives a good speed up for games such as Gauntlet, Marble Madness and other Atari games.

Changes by Franxis:
Raiden CPU frequency fixed (reduced from 20 to 10 MHz). Still very slow.

MAME4ALL 1.3 (05/04/2008)
-------------------------
Changes by Headoverheels:
- New Gaelco games added (MAME 0.37b7): Big Karnak (bigkarnk) and Biomechanical Toy (biomtoy).
- New SunA 8 bit games added (MAME 0.37b15): Hard Head (hardhead), Hard Head (Bootleg) (hardhedb) and Rough Ranger (rranger).
- Optimizations in Xain'd Sleena.
- Fixed the NEC cpu bug that caused slowdowns in Raiden (MAME 0.37b15).
- Fixed some bugs in the I86/NEC cpu emulation. This includes raster effects problems in Geostorm and the 99 credits bug in Lethal Thunder (MAME 0.66).

Changes by Franxis:

MAME4ALL 1.2 (18/03/2008)
-------------------------
Another bug fix version:

- Random problems with USB joypads should be gone.
- The four players can be controlled with the GP2X joypad.
- The coinage and start buttons of the four players can be controlled with the GP2X joypad (see readme.txt).

MAME4ALL 1.1 (16/03/2008)
-------------------------
Bug fix version:
- Improved the DrZ80 compatibility. A lot of new games are compatible (Neo·Geo games, Bubble Bobble, Tokio, etc).
- High Scores support. Thanks to PalMAME for the hiscore.dat file.
- Fixed the video output in the vector games.
- Fixed the video orientation in the Bubble Bobble bootleg version (Bobble Bobble).
- Bubble Bobble can be played fullspeed now thanks to the DrZ80 core. I recommend to use the bootleg versions
  (Bobble Bobble and Super Bubble Bobble) because the emulation is faster.
- New great skins for the menu by Pedator.
